                <p>Precious stones for a very long time was a secret love of mine, my admiration of them grew as I got older
                and ever since I delved into investing & learning about their backgrounds and how they are crafted within
                jewellery designs in my spare time. In the future, it is definately a goal of mine to achieve becoming a jewellery
                designer. To name a few some of favourite jewellery designers and brands consist of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Angei Marei </li>
                    <li> Elsa Peretti </li>
                    <li> Cartier </li>
                    <li> Rainbow K jewellery </li>
